# JavaScript Arrays

Until now, we've only dealt with one piece of information at a time: one number, one string, one element on a page. But, often we need to group things together. For example, what if we wanted to have a list of the months of the year? We'd use an array, which is just a list of things grouped together.

Here are a few examples of arrays assigned to variables: -

```JavaScript
var months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May"]

var numbers = [17, 15, 14, 3, 5, 10]

var combined = [17, "January", 15, "February", 14, "March", 3, "April", 5, "May", 10]

```
Notice that strings in an array have quotes, but numbers don't need them.

The anatomy of an array consists of the following characteristics:

* Opening and closing **square brackets** [ ] with a comma in between each item.

* The **value** in between each commma

* And a hidden **index** that exists behind each value

Note that the **index starts at 0** and increases by 1 each time.  So, the first value we see is actually at index 0.

```JavaScript
var letters = ["l", "e", "a", "r", "n", " ", "S", "D"]

```

In the above example, the first letter "l" is at index 0 and the letter "r" is at index 3.  So, the letter "S"
 is at what index?


#### Accessing Elements

We can use our variable (in this case letters) and an index number in square brackets to pull out values in an array.

```javascript
var letters = ["l", "e", "a", "r", "n", " ", "S", "D"];

console.log(letters[3])
r

console.log(letters[7])
D

console.log(letters[8])
undefined

```

#### Changing Elements

We can also reassign values in an array by using the variable, square brackets, and the index with an '=' and a new value.

```javascript

var letters = ["l", "e", "a", "r", "n", " ", "S", "D"];

letters[2] = "SEE"
console.log(letters);
["l", "e", "SEE", "r", "n", " ", "S", "D"]

letters[4] = 100
console.log(letters);
["l", "e", "SEE", "r", 100, " ", "S", "D"]

```
#### Built-in Methods
JavaScript has many array methods that help us to manipulate our arrays.  Let's look at a few examples:

* **.length** - gives you the length of an array (a read only property, not a function).

```javascript

var array1 = [1, 7, 10, 9, 3, 4, 2]

console.log(array1.length);
7

```

**Mutators** - also know as "setters" - methods that change the original array.

* **.push()** - pushes a value into the end of an array
* **.pop()** - removes and returns the last value in an array
* **.shift()** - removes the first value in an array
* **.unshift(value)** - adds a new element to the beginning of an array
* **.reverse()** - reverses the order of the values in an array


Let's do a few examples with mutator methods.

```JavaScript
var colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]

colors.push("black", "teal")
console.log(colors);
["red", "green", "blue", "black", "teal"]

colors.pop()
console.log(colors);
["red", "green", "blue", "black"]

colors.shift()
console.log(colors);
["green", "blue", "black"]

colors.unshift("magenta")
console.log(colors);
["magenta", "green", "blue", "black"]

colors.reverse()
console.log(colors);
["black", "blue", "green", "magenta"]


```


**Accessors** - also known as "getters" - methods that access an array and do not change the original array.  

* **.concat()** - merges two or more arrays to form one combined array
* **.join("")** - converts all values in an array to a string
* **.indexOf()** - gives the index of a given value
* **.lastIndexOf()** - gives us the last index of a value (usually used when there are values that are the same)

Let's look at some examples of accessor methods.  

```JavaScript
var letters = ["m", "o", "n"]
var letters2 = ["d", "a", "y"]


console.log(letters.concat(letters2))
["m", "o", "n", "d", "a", "y"]
```
Notice that we get the output that we want. But, because **.concat()** is an accessor method, we need a way to use our combined array later in our program.  We do this by setting it to a variable.

```JavaScript
var letters = ["m", "o", "n"]
var letters2 = ["d", "a", "y"]


var combined = letters.concat(letters2))
console.log(combined);
["m", "o", "n", "d", "a", "y"]
```

In this next example, we are setting a variable called 'joined' and using the **.join("")** method.  This takes our array and turns it into a string.  You can also see that we need to put quotes in the parentheses of the method.  What happens if you put a space between the quotes?  What if we put a symbol like '$' ?



```javascript

var combined = ["m", "o", "n", "d", "a", "y"]

var joined = combined.join("")
console.log(joined);
"monday"

```
In this next example we will take our string and turn it back into an array using the **.split()** method.  We will also save this new array into a variable.  

```JavaScript
var joined = "monday"

var newArr = joined.split("")
console.log(newArr);
["m", "o", "n", "d", "a", "y"]

```

And finally, let's look at **.indexOf** and **lastIndexOf**.

```JavaScript
var arr1 = ["S", 2, "y", 3, "y", 1, "t" ]

console.log(arr1.indexOf("t"))
6

console.log(arr1.lastIndexOf("y"));
4
```
## Array Destructuring

The destructuring assignment is really just a special way of assigning variables in JavaScript. What's great about the destructuring assignment is that it allows you to take something like an array or an object and unpack their values into individual variables.
Array destructuring allows us to assign values from an array to variables. Though array destructuring won't be immediately useful to us, it's good to know a little bit about what it affords us.

```javascript
let [firstVal, secondVal] = [1, 2]

console.log(firstVal)   // => 1
console.log(secondVal)  // => 2
```

Notice that an array destructuring assigment:

- Starts with a variable keyword
- In square brackets lists some variable names
- Uses the assignment operator to assign the array to unpack

Also notice that the variables are assigned in order. As in, the first variable name is assigned the first value of the value array.


## Challenges
