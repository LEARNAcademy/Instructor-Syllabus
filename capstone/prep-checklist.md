- Elevator pitch (30 sec summary of the app)
- Wireframes - visual representations of all the pages your user will see

### Trello Board
- Swim lanes: done, doing, mvp, icebox, blockers, code review
- If a card is in doing, a developer's name should be a name assigned to it

### User stories
A user story describes how a user interacts with an app. It is told from the userâ€™s perspective. Keep user stories simple and concise and use an active voice.

User stories should be actionable. There should be a clear understanding of when a story is "done".
