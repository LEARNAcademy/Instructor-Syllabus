# BEHAVIOR DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

[![YouTube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/NhhzRtJC8bg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhhzRtJC8bg)

### [Video of BDD with Rspec and Ruby](https://player.vimeo.com/video/168104193)

The process to follow is:

1) Determine a feature or behavior to implement.
2) Create the describe and it blocks for pertaining to the that feature only. If there are more than one it block, put in pending in the blocks.
3) Put in expects in one it block to assert how the objects/the system should behave.
4) Run the tests and see that they fail.
5) Implement just enough of the software to make the tests pass.
6) Add more expects and repeat the process, until all tests pass and all features are implemented.

### Set Up
Create a file called car.rb and file called car_spec.rb in the same folder.
Put the following into the spec file:

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative 'car'
```

- require 'rspec' - searches the gem file path and grabs it.
- require_relative 'car' - gets the car, which is within the same folder.

In the terminal, cd to the folder with the files; then:

```bash
rspec car_spec.rb
```

and see that world is good and fine.  If it is not, such as if this is the first time you've run `rspec` or you are setting up your development environment in AWS there are two commands you'll need to enter into the AWS terminal to properly test your ruby files.

```bash
sudo apt install rspec-ruby-core
gem install rspec
```

After the commands run you're ready to get to work!  There are additional links and documentation at the end of this document for setting up rspec on your computer.

## Getting to Work
### First Feature: A Car is a Thing
Write the first test within the car_spec.rb file:
Car has to be a thing, in other words, Car has to be a class that we can use.

```RUBY
describe "Car" do
  it "has to be real" do
    expect{Car.new}.to_not raise_error
  end
end
```

Run your test in the Terminal:

```bash
rspec car_spec.rb
```

Now implement a Car class in the car.rb file:

```bash
class Car
end
```

And run the tests again. Do they pass? YES!

You can now change the test to use the class name: describe Car do instead of the string.

Great on to the next feature!

### Feature Two: Cars have Color
#### Story: A Car has a Color

We can express this as:

```bash
...
  it "has a color" do
    a_car = Car.new
    expect(a_car.color).to be_a String
  end
...
```

The be_a matcher will take a class name. When we give it String, our example car passes the test.

#### Story: A Car's color can be changed

```bash
...
  it "can change color" do
    a_car = Car.new
    a_car.color = "Red"
    expect(a_car.color).to eq "Red"
  end
...
```

With this test, we create a new car and assign it a color. For this test we use the eq matcher, which will compare your expectation to the test's result exactly as it is.

In the process, we realize that a_car.color should never have an empty value and that value should always be a String, otherwise our test that checks for class type won't pass. Let's write a new test to reflect this default behavior:

```bash
...
  it "has a color when it's created" do
    a_car = Car.new
    expect(a_car.color).to be_a String
    expect(a_car.color).to eq "Unpainted"
  end
...
```

### Feature Three: The need for Speed
#### Story: Cars have Speed

```bash
...
  it "has a speed" do
    a_car = Car.new
    expect(a_car.speed).to be_a Numeric
  end
...
```

We expect car.speed to be a number. We use the Numeric class in our test because it is the broadest class that includes round numbers; it includes Fixnum and Integer.

#### Story: A car's Initial Speed is Zero

```bash
...
  it "starts at speed zero" do
    a_car = Car.new
    expect(a_car.speed).to be 0
  end
...
```

#### Story: A Car can Accelerate

```bash
...
  it "can accelerate by an amount" do
    a_car = Car.new
    a_car.accelerate_by 42

    # A weak expectation
    expect(a_car.speed).to be > 0

    # Simple way to test
    expect(a_car.speed).to be 42

    # Alternative way to test
    expect{a_car.accelerate_by(13)}.to change{a_car.speed}.from(42).to(13+42)
  end
...
```

The Outcome
The outcome of our labor - the deliverables - are the specification of the software, the rspec file, and an implementation that works according to the specification.

```bash
require 'rspec'
require_relative 'car'

describe Car do

  it "is a thing" do
    expect{Car.new}.to_not raise_error
  end

  it "always has a color" do
    a_car = Car.new
    expect(a_car.color).to be_a String
    expect(a_car.color).to eq "Unpainted"
  end

  it "can change color" do
    a_car = Car.new
    a_car.color = "Red"
    expect(a_car.color).to eq "Red"
  end

  it "has a speed" do
    a_car = Car.new
    expect(a_car.speed).to be_a Numeric
  end

  it "starts at speed zero" do
    a_car = Car.new
    expect(a_car.speed).to be 0
  end

  it "can accelerate by an amount" do
    a_car = Car.new
    a_car.accelerate_by 42
    expect{a_car.accelerate_by(13)}.to change{a_car.speed}.from(42).to(13+42)
  end

end
class Car

  def initialize
    @color = "Unpainted"
    @speed = 0
  end

  def color
    @color
  end

  def color= new_color
    @color = new_color
  end

  def speed
    @speed
  end

  def accelerate_by add_speed_by
    @speed = @speed + add_speed_by
  end

end
```

## Set Up Rspec
To get great looking output, create a file called .rspec in your home folder
(which you can get to by typing just cd in the Terminal).
Put the following in the file:

```
--color --format documentation
```
