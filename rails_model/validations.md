# Active Record Validations

## Overview
- Validations are used to ensure that only valid data is saved into your database.
- There are lots of ways to validate data, in this section we will talk about model validations.

## Learning Objectives
- Exploring the implementation of model validations
- Practicing with validation syntax

## Vocabulary
- validations

## Set Up

#### Creating a new Rails app:
```
$ rails new myapp -d postgresql -T
$ cd myapp
$ rails db:create
$ rails server
```

In a browser navigate to:
`http://localhost:3000`

## Validates Presence
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, :login, :email, presence: true
end
```

## Validates Length
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, length: { minimum: 2 }
  validates :bio, length: { maximum: 500 }
  validates :password, length: { in: 6..20 }
  validates :registration_number, length: { is: 6 }
end
```

## Validates belongs_to
Starting in Rails 5 the `belongs_to` side of relationships is validated by default.
```
class Phone < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :person  #default validation for belongs to presence: true
end
```

If you want an optional `belongs_to` relationship, you can set it up like this:
```
class Phone < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :person, optional: true
end
```


## Validates Uniqueness

```
class Account < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, uniqueness: true
  validates :email, uniqueness: { case_sensitive: false }
end
```

## When Validations are Called

The following methods trigger validations, and will save the object to the database only if the object is valid:
```
create
create!
save
save!
update
update!
```

The bang versions (e.g. save!) raise an exception if the record is invalid. `save` and `update` will return `false`, `create` just returns the object the method was called on if it is invalid.

### Valid?
To verify whether or not an object is valid, Rails uses the `.valid?` method. You can also use this method on your own. `valid?` triggers your validations and returns true if no errors were found in the object, and false otherwise.

## To Access Errors

To verify whether or not a particular attribute of an object is valid, you can use errors[:attribute]. It returns an array of all the errors for :attribute. If there are no errors on the specified attribute, an empty array is returned.
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
end

>> person = Person.new
>> person.valid?         # => false
>> person.errors[:name]  # => ["can't be blank"] array of error messages for name field
```


## Challenges

You have been tasked to set up an Account model for a your company. The application must be secure.

### Stories for Account:
- As a developer, I need to generate a model called Account that has a username, a password, and an email
- As a developer, I need username, password, and email to be required
- As a developer, I need every username to be at least 5 characters long
- As a developer, I need each username to be unique
- As a developer, I need each password to be at least 6 characters long
- As a developer, I need each password to be unique

### Stories for Address:
- As a developer, I want my Account model to have many associated Addresses
- As a developer, I want Address to have street_number, street_name, city, state, and zip attributes
- As a developer, I want to validate all fields on Address


### Stretch Challenges
Implementing [Custom Validations](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#performing-custom-validations):

- As a developer, I need each Account password to have at least one number.
- As a developer, I need each Account password to have at least one special character.
- As a developer, I want to validate that Address street_number, street_name, zip are unique for within an account.
	- **Hint:** Read about :scope in the Rails validation docs.
- As a developer, I want to validate that the Address street_number and zip are numbers.
- As a developer, I want to see a custom error message that says "Please, input numbers only." if street_number or zip code are not numbers.
  - **Hint:** Read about :message in the Rails validation docs.
- As a developer, I want to validate associated addresses on accounts.
	- **Hint:** Read about validates_associated in the Rails validation docs.
