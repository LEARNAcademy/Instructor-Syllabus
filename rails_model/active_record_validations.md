# Rails Active Record Validations

Data validations can be used in the model `class` to insure incomplete, invalid, or incorrect data from being saved in the database.

Here are a list of validations that can be implemented.

[Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#acceptance)

#### Length

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, length: { minimum: 2 }
  validates :bio, length: { maximum: 500 }
  validates :password, length: { in: 6..20 }
  validates :registration_number, length: { is: 6 }
end
```

#### Presence

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, :login, :email, presence: true
end
```

Starting in Rails 5,  belongs_to side of relationships is validated by default
```
class Phone < ApplicationRecord
	belongs_to :person  #default validation for belongs to: presence: true
end
```

If you want an optional belongs_to relationship, you can set it up like this:
```
class Phone < ApplicationRecord
	belongs_to :person, optional: true
end
```


#### Uniqueness

```
class Account < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, uniqueness: true
  validates :email, uniqueness: { case_sensitive: false }
end
```

## When Validations are Called

The following methods trigger validations, and will save the object to the database only if the object is valid:
```
create
create!
save
save!
update
update!
valid?
invalid?
```

The bang versions (e.g. save!) raise an exception if the record is invalid. The non-bang versions don't, save and update return false, create just returns the object.

To verify whether or not an object is valid, Rails uses the valid? method. You can also use this method on your own. valid? triggers your validations and returns true if no errors were found in the object, and false otherwise.

## To Access Errors

To verify whether or not a particular attribute of an object is valid, you can use errors[:attribute]. It returns an array of all the errors for :attribute. If there are no errors on the specified attribute, an empty array is returned.
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
end

>> person = Person.new
>> person.valid? 			# => false
>> peroson.errors[:name] 	# => ["can't be blank"]	# array of error messages for name field
```

## Active Record Validations Intro Challenges

You have been tasked to set up an Account model for the users in your companyâ€™s application and they want it to be secure.

### Stories:

- As a developer, I need to generate accounts that require a username, a password, and an email
- As a developer, I need each password to be unique
- As a developer, I need every username to be at least 5 characters long
- As a developer, I need each username to be unique
- As a developer, I need each password to be at least 6 characters long

### Stretch Challenges

These will require a little bit of research to implement. Visit this link on [Custom Validations](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#performing-custom-validations) for documentation on how to implement custom methods for validation.

- As a developer, I need each password to have at least one number
- As a developer, I need each password to have at least one special character

### Super Stretch Challenges
- As a developer, I want accounts to have a has_many associated Addresses
- As a developer, I want addresses to have street_number, street_name, city, state, and zip attributes
- As a developer, I want to validate all fields on an address
- As a developer, I want to validate that (street_number, street_name, zip) are unique for within an account
	- ** Hint:  Read about :scope in the Rails validation docs
- As a developer, I want to validate associated addresses on accounts
	- ** Hint:  Read about validates_associated in the Rails validation docs

For all these challenges check your work by exploring the ActiveRecord commands. (new, valid?, create, etc.)
