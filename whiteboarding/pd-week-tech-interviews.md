# PD Week Technical Interviews
Technical interviews take place on Wednesday of Professional Development week. Typically from 1-3pm.

Each instruction takes 3-5 students and runs through a mock technical interview.

The instructor should take the role of tech lead interviewing a junior developer. The interview should be a a combination of intro/personal questions, technical questions, and coding challenges.

The following are options for questions. Additional questions are available here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ufjuBht0eiyvXWDiNWaTo3nsmLov6eZRI6UAT5d_qk/edit
