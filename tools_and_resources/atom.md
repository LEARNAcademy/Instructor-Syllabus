# Atom Text Editor

Atom is a text and source code editor developed by Github. There are lots of great text editors, but at Learn we use Atom because it is free, open-sourced, and user friendly. Atom can be run from Mac, Windows, or Linux operating system and supports all the languages we use at Learn as well as Node.js integration, git control
