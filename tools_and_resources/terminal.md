# Terminal Info and Shortcuts

## Basics
What is terminal? <br />
Terminal is a platform to give text-based commands to your computer. Lots of the daily interaction we have with our computers is done through the graphical user interface (GUI) such as viewing windows, clicking on icons and buttons, or using drag and drop. The development of GUIs is what made computers usable for the general population and launched the popularity of the personal computer. However, using the command line interface (CLI) gives programmers a whole other level of interaction with our computers. By giving commands directly to the computer, we have more control over our programs and gain access to built in functionality. There are certain aspects of coding that cannot be properly executed through the GUI such as git commands and version managers. Plus, it looks super cool and hackery. It is sure to impress your parents!

## Accessing Terminal
Terminal can be accessed by opening finder >> applications >> utilities >> terminal. Or find terminal using a handy shortcut. Typing `command spacebar` will open Spotlight Search where you can search for terminal. We will use terminal a lot so saving it to your doc is recommended.

## Extras
There are programs that help add a bit of flare and functionality to your terminal. One we like at Learn is a shell called ZSH (Z shell). Find out more <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH" target="_blank">here.</a>
