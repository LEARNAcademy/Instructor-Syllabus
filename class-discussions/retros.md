# Friday Retros

Every Friday we take 30 minutes to reflect on the events of the week. At the beginning of the cohort the retros are more self-reflective and an opportunity to look for red-flags and gain introspective on the group personality of the class. Retros are typically open discussion lead by one of the instructors.


Here is a list of possible retro discussion prompts. Retros can be molded to suit the needs of the instruction team. Some classes will need more prompts than others.
