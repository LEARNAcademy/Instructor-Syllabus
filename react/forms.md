## Overview
- Taking a closer look at managing state in components
- Handling state changes in components
- Managing the internal state of a component with state and communicating state between components with props
- Adding a form to a component that will update state

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding how a component passes information from state to another component as props
- Adding input fields
- Creating a method to handle DOM event changes (what the user types)
- Creating a method to set state with the user input


## Vocabulary
- state
- props
- input, value, onChange
- dumb/display component
- smart/logic component
- DOM event, often shortened to `e`

#### Creating a new React app:
```
yarn create react-app myApp
cd myApp
yarn start
```

## Step 1
Let's take a closer look at the difference between component state and props by adding an input element to the page.

We'll create a smart component that holds state and passes information to a child component called `Greeter`.

**src/App.js**
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'
// importing the Greeter component
import Greeter from './Greeter'

class App extends Component{
  constructor(props){
    super(props)
    // creating a state object that contains a key of "name" and a value of "Bob"
    this.state = {
      name: "Bob"
    }
  }

  render(){
    return(
      <div>
        {/* <Greeter /> is getting passed the information from the state object as props called "name" */}
        <Greeter
          name={ this.state.name }
        />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
export default App
```

## Step 2
Now the child component `Greeter` will display the name value passed as props from the parent component. This component is `display or dumb`. It accepts a greeting in props, and displays it.

**src/Greeter.js**
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'

// Greeter is a dumb/display component that does not hold state
class Greeter extends Component {
  render() {
    // We are passing the state object value as props called "name" <name={ this.state.name }> from the parent App.js
    return (
      <h1>Hello, { this.props.name }! </h1>
    )
  }
}

export default Greeter
```
In the browser we will see: `Hello, Bob!`

## Step 3
To increase the functionality of our app, let's add a way for our user to enter their name rather than having a hardcoded name in state. To do this we need a text input and a method that will update state as our user types in the input.

**src/App.js**
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'
// importing the Greeter component
import Greeter from './Greeter'

class App extends Component{
  constructor(props){
    super(props)
    // changing the state object to hold an empty string
    this.state = {
      name: ""
    }
  }

  handleChange = (event) => {
    // a method that will take the value from an input and save it in the state key "name"
    this.setState({ name: event.target.value })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {/* adding a JSX tag <input /> that will call the handleChange method and pass the value of the state object */}
        <input
          value={ this.state.name }
          onChange={ this.handleChange }
        />
        {/* same information being passed as props to <Greeter /> */}
        <Greeter
          name={ this.state.name }
        />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
export default App
```
In our example, the JSX input tag takes two attributes:
  - `value` of our state object
  - `onChange` that calls a method called handleChange that will collect the information entered in the input and update state!

**Notice** that for the input, we need both a `value` and `onChange`. `<input>` has its own internal state, so we need to use the props `value` and `onChange` to pass the proper context into it. The input is re-rendered every time the state of the component changes.

The information from the input is passed to the child `Greeter` component.

## Step 4
We can change the user output by adding a method in the `Greeter` component.

**src/Greeter.js**
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'

class Greeter extends Component {
  // Greeter is a dumb/display component that does not hold state

  capitalizer = (userInput) => {
    // a display component can have its own methods that act on the information being passed as props
    return userInput.toUpperCase()
  }

  render() {
    return (
      {/* calling a method and passing the information from the input */}
      <h1>Hello, { this.capitalizer(this.props.name) }! </h1>
    )
  }
}

export default Greeter
```

## Step 5

As our app grows, we'll likely want to move the `<input />` into its own component.

**src/App.js**
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'
// importing the Greeter component
import Greeter from './Greeter'
// importing the NameInput component that we are about to create
import NameInput from './NameInput'

class App extends Component{
  constructor(props){
    super(props)
    // state object stays the same
    this.state = {
      name: ""
    }
  }

  updateName = (name) => {
    // this method is passed as props to <NameInput /> so the value from the child component can be passed back "up river" to the parent App.js
    this.setState({ name: name })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {/* <Greeter /> gets the same information as props */}
        <Greeter
          name={ this.state.name }
        />
        {/* <NameInput /> gets the information from state and a method as props  */}
        <NameInput
          name={ this.state.name }
          updateName={ this.updateName }
        />
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

## Step 6
Let's create a new child component called `NameInput` and move the input into this component. We need to refactor the `value` attribute and create a new `handleChange` method for this component.

**src/NameInput.js**
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'

class NameInput extends Component {
  // NameInput is a dumb/display component that does not hold state

  handleChange = (event) => {
    // method that takes the value from the input and calls updateName
    this.props.updateName(event.target.value)
  }

  render() {
    // the JSX tag <input /> has the value of name coming as props from App.js
    return (
      <input
        value={ this.props.name }
        onChange={ this.handleChange }
      />
    )
  }
}

export default NameInput
```

## 2) Mad Libs

#### User Stories
- As a user, I can see a page with many text inputs.
- As a user, I can see labels next to the text inputs indicating what part of speech (or type of word) should be entered into each text form: nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adjectives.
- As a user, I can fill out the inputs.
- As a user, after I have filled out the text inputs I can click a 'Submit' button.
- As a user, when I click 'Submit' I see a paragraph appear on the page that contains the words I entered in the text forms to create a funny story.
- As a user, I can click a 'Clear' button that removes the story and the text inputs and returns the page to the original state.
